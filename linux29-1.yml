What is a Computers 
  Computers have 2 components  = Hardware + Software
     Hardware: CPU, Screen, keyboard, mouse, harddrive, RAM, Cards   
     software: OS = Operating system, applications    

Types of Computers:  
  Personal Computers: Desktop, Laptop, IPADs, Tablets, Phones, etc. 
  work Computers: Workstations, Servers (super computers)   

Types Operating systems running in computers:
    Linux OS []
       Majority of Workstations, Servers (super computers)  
    Windows OS []
       Majority of Workstations, Laptops, Desktop
    Solaris OS []

    Androids []

Can I computer have more than ONE OS at once?? 99% 

What determines the choice of an OS:
Common OS are Windows, MacOS, Linux and Solaris
  -- COST  
         $400 for a windows OS licence 
         $350 for a Solaris OS licence 
         00$ for a Linux OS licence 
  -- security
       Virus attack   --- Windows  
       No Virus attack--- Linux

How are tasks runned/executed on computers???
How are tasks runned/executed on computers???

We are leveraging computing serviceS from AWS and GCP
 Linux OS = 
   Is an Open source OS = Free + code 

 Linus was a student who converted a problem to a business
 Solaris wasn't an open source = paid for 
 Create a free Account in AWS =  

Computer Vendors:
  Dell, HP, Lenovo, Toshiba, Apple
      A Dell Laptop with a windows OS is a Windows Computer  
      An HP Desktop with a Linux OS is a Linux Computer 
      An LG Desktop with a Linux OS is a Linux Computer 

Car Vendors:
  Toyota, Tesla, Ford, Honda

Linus was using a Solaris computer for his project.
   -- Encounter a problem running his project  
   -- He contacted the vendor but the response delayed     

Linus created the Linux OS from Solaris kernel []:

Linux is an open source OS with multiple destributions/versions.
Windows, Solaris, MacOS, etc are licenced OS.
Softwares can be:
  1. open source [Free with its source code]  
     open source softwares has more community support

  2. Free [free but without the source code(recipe)] 
  3. licenced [paid for]  

IQ: Explain your experience in Open SOURCE TECHNOLOGY?? Linux, 

IQ: How to execute tasks/workloads in Linux servers:
IQ: How to execute tasks/workloads on your computers:
     1. GUI = Graphical User Interface  = 60k
            -- This is generally a method manual to run tasks
     2. CLI = Command Line Interface =    90k
            -- This introduces tasks automation   
     3. Scripts = Are generally a collection of commands = 180k 
           -- amplifies tasks automation 

 I have windows Laptop with default Folders [Directories]    
   Folders [MY PC, document, downlaods, music, pictures, Desktop]

Tasks:
  Create 10 sub-Folders in your music folder of your windows Laptop  
  Create 10 folders using commands in your Linux Server

How and where I can buy and use Linux servers:

What is needed to drive from Houston to Dallas??
     Car [Buy, Hired/Rent, Taxi] 
We shall rent/buy computing serviceS from a Cloud Provider like:
   AWS = amazon web serviceS
   GCP 
   AZURE
  This will be ultra-fast 


     https://aws.amazon.com/ 
Amazon is the parent company of AWS 
    amazon.com 
    aws.amazon.com

We use write and deliver letters:
  ups, dhl  
  email   

 Create a free Account in AWS =  
    https://aws.amazon.com/ 

Create and Login into your AWS Account:
  userName  
  password
Create a virtual server [EC2] in YOUR AWS ACCOUNT/Cloud. 

3. Connect to your Linux server running in AWS using:
    1. ssh-client software [provide a passage]
         mobaXterm, puTTY, gitBash
         Download an install mobaXterm ssh-client software
    2. identification = userName  
    3. authentication = password or an SSH_KEY   
    4. AUTHORISATION = what you do in the server  
       Tasks that a user is AUTHORISE to execute  

AWS 90%:
   Admin[mobaXterm]  ---- > EC2-Linux 

GCP 10%:
